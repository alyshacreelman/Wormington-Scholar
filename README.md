Welcome to the Wormington Scholar Chatbot!

Wormington is a freindly, green worm that happens to be very intelligent. Not only is he a smart guy... he is a great teacher! Wormington knows how to tailor his responses to multiple different age groups including:
- Elementary School
- Middle School
- High School
- College

Wormington was adapted from Yang's Chatbot created for a CS 553 class example. Alysha, Erika, and Jen worked on this modification!
